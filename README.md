BiG-CZ-Toolbox
==============

Work on the python toolboxes for advanced access and interaction with the BiG CZ data services.

Will likely create a Python configuration based on Anaconda and conda packages. Will connect to IOOS efforts at https://github.com/ioos/conda-recipes, and its linked binstar channels at https://binstar.org/ioos/, https://binstar.org/rsignell/. Also conda recipes at https://github.com/pyoceans/conda-recipes-pyoceans/
