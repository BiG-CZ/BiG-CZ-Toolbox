BiG-CZ-Toolbox
==============

Work on the python toolboxes for advanced access and interaction with the BiG CZ data services.

## Multi-platform, easy-to-install Python environment based on Conda

Will create a Python configuration based on the [Conda package management system](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) ([Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is based on conda). Will connect to IOOS efforts, with conda recipes at https://github.com/ioos/conda-recipes and its linked binstar conda channels at https://binstar.org/ioos/. Or if it takes off, the broader [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) effort.

[This is a terrific, recent and comprehensive introduction to conda](http://www.continuum.io/blog/conda-data-science) targeted to data scientists. It also has links to a presentation (Youtube and slides) on the same material. An extra nifty aspect of this material is that it "explores how to use conda in a multi-language data science project" with an example combining Python and R libraries (conda now supports R as well).
