Emilio's IPython Notebook Demos from BigCZ 2014-Oct meeting at Stroud
=====================================================
All notebooks except *BiGCZ_Demo_2_IGSN_DynamicMaps.ipynb* are exactly as ran at the meeting. The IGSN demo has been modified during subsequent exploratory work, and might not run top-to-bottom any more. *BiGCZ_Demo_4_ulmo_crbwofpy_vizer.ipynb* may not work any more, b/c it was written when the CZO Central WOF services were 1.0 and they have since been upgraded to 1.1; but worth testing, it probably runs just fine.

If you're not very familiar with IPython notebooks and how to render (view) them online with [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org), just [go here and click on the notebook to view in nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BiG-CZ/BiG-CZ-Toolbox/tree/master/ipynotebooks/2014OctMeeting/). 

**Updates, 8/8/2015:**
- IPython notebooks is now known as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks; the project has evolved beyond Python to support many, many languages.
- As of May 2015, [Github now supports automatic rendering of IPython notebooks!](https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/). This is a fantastic development. But note this small caveat from the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)/Jupyter team: "because of security concerns, some features available on nbviewer will not be available on GitHub. For example, GitHub will not render any dynamic output display that uses JavaScript, custom CSS, and most custom HTML embedded in Markdown or in outputs. When this is the case, and GitHub cannot fully render your notebooks, you will see an icon that allows you to view the full notebook on nbviewer."
