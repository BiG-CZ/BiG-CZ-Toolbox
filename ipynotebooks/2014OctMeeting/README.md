Emilio's IPython Notebook Demos from BigCZ 2014-Oct meeting at Stroud
=====================================================
All notebooks except *BiGCZ_Demo_2_IGSN_DynamicMaps.ipynb* are exactly as ran at the meeting. The IGSN demo has been modified during subsequent exploratory work, and might not run top-to-bottom any more. *BiGCZ_Demo_4_ulmo_crbwofpy_vizer.ipynb* may not work any more, b/c it was written when the CZO Central WOF services were 1.0 and they have since been upgraded to 1.1; but worth testing, it probably runs just fine.

If you're not very familiar with IPython notebooks and how to render (view) them online with [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org), just [go here and click on the notebook to view in nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BiG-CZ/BiG-CZ-Toolbox/tree/master/ipynotebooks/2014OctMeeting/)
