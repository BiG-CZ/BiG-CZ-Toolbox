The stations operate 24 hours a day, year round, on solar power and  batteries.  All monitoring stations are accessible via paved or dirt roads except the Sheep Montane station, which requires a 1.5 hr hike.  No other facilities are associated with the towers, but sufficient power and expansion capabilities are provided so that additional sensors can be added.  \n",

A webcam is mounted on each tower to provide real time assessment of site conditions as well as archival photographs to help assess plant phenology, snow depth and snow melt timing.\n",

</td><td>CRWA's advocacy and design work require a strong scientific and holistic understanding of the Charles River watershed. As a result, CRWA began a comprehensive water quality monitoring program for the Charles River and its tributaries in 1995, which includes a foundation of water quality data generated by volunteers. This data provides baseline information of the river's health and allows for the analysis of spatial, temporal, and meteorological water quality trends for a number of water quality parameters.\n",

stem of the Taunton River at four locations Berkley to Bridgewater along with critical tributaries feeding the river at fifteen additional locations during the early morning hours the second Tuesday of each month March to November. The reason they do this is to provide the watershed a regular check-up essential to continue the focus on correction of previously identified problems and to identify new issues. TRWA monitors nitrate, total phosphorus, fecal coliform bacteria, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature.

a set of monitoring stations that was funded by a National Science Foundation EPSCoR climate change grant. The stations operate 24 hours a day, year round, on solar power and  batteries.  All monitoring stations are accessible via paved or dirt roads except the Sheep Montane station, which requires a 1.5 hr hike.  No other facilities are associated with the towers, but sufficient power and expansion capabilities are provided so that additional sensors can be added.  \n",

       "A consistent set of sensors are installed at each station to monitor precipitation, air temperature, wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation, net radiation, relative humidity, barometric pressure, soil moisture and temperature at several depths. A webcam is mounted on each tower to provide real time assessment of site conditions as well as archival photographs to help assess plant phenology, snow depth and snow melt timing.\n",

design work require a strong scientific and holistic understanding of the Charles River watershed. As a result, CRWA began a comprehensive water quality monitoring program for the Charles River and its tributaries in 1995, which includes a foundation of water quality data generated by volunteers. This data provides baseline information of the river's health and allows for the analysis of spatial, temporal, and meteorological water quality trends for a number of water quality parameters.\n",

stem of the Taunton River at four locations Berkley to Bridgewater along with critical tributaries feeding the river at fifteen additional locations during the early morning hours the second Tuesday of each month March to November. The reason they do this is to provide the watershed a regular check-up essential to continue the focus on correction of previously identified problems and to identify new issues.

a set of monitoring stations that was funded by a National Science Foundation EPSCoR climate change grant. The stations operate 24 hours a day, year round, on solar power and  batteries.  All monitoring stations are accessible via paved or dirt roads except the Sheep Montane station, which requires a 1.5 hr hike.  No other facilities are associated with the towers, but sufficient power and expansion capabilities are provided so that additional sensors can be added.  \n",

       "A consistent set of sensors are installed at each station to monitor precipitation, air temperature, wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation, net radiation, relative humidity, barometric pressure, soil moisture and temperature at several depths. A webcam is mounted on each tower to provide real time assessment of site conditions as well as archival photographs to help assess plant phenology, snow depth and snow melt timing.\n",

       "Networking capabilities provide real time transmission of data and webcam images to the Nevada Climate Change Data Portal where any interested person may download data free-of-charge. A subset of the data also are available from the Western Regional Climate Center.  | 10502004

design work require a strong scientific and holistic understanding of the Charles River watershed. As a result, CRWA began a comprehensive water quality monitoring program for the Charles River and its tributaries in 1995, which includes a foundation of water quality data generated by volunteers. This data provides baseline information of the river's health and allows for the analysis of spatial, temporal, and meteorological water quality trends for a number of water quality parameters.\n",

       "3 NevCAN is a set of monitoring stations that was funded by a National Science Foundation EPSCoR climate change grant. The stations operate 24 hours a day, year round, on solar power and  batteries.  All monitoring stations are accessible via paved or dirt roads except the Sheep Montane station, which requires a 1.5 hr hike.  No other facilities are associated with the towers, but sufficient power and expansion capabilities are provided so that additional sensors can be added.  \\n\\nA consistent set of sensors are installed at each station to monitor precipitation, air temperature, wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation, net radiation, relative humidity, barometric pressure, soil moisture and temperature at several depths. A webcam is mounted on each tower to provide real time assessment of site conditions as well as archival photographs to help assess plant phenology, snow depth and snow melt timing.\\n\\nNetworking capabilities provide real time transmission of data and webcam images to the Nevada Climate Change Data Portal where any interested person may download data free-of-charge. A subset of the data also are available from the Western Regional Climate Center. \n",
